      <p id="testP" class="funParagraph"><b>HI!</b> &amp; Welcome to a little introductory of me. My name is Karolyn and I am here to tell you the many different things that make me, me! From my 
         home to my hobbies, friends to family, and a little more. First though, I will start with the base of me.
         <p>I was born in Charlotte, North Carolina on June 23 and although I lived in a few other states, I have spent most of my life in Charlotte. I am the oldest out of 
            3 on my mothers side with a 21-year-old sister and a 20-year-old brother. I am currently residing in Charlotte with my significant other, Jason, and our fur babies
            Oktober and Adonis.
